# XLEngine

## TODO
* game plugin fix-ups
* have cmake place images, as and other things into the build directory

## Dependencies
* DevIL (libdevil-dev) Cross-platform image loading and manipulation toolkit
* enet (libenet-dev) Thin network communication layer on top of UDP
* GLEW (libglew-dev) OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library
* SDL2 (libsdl2-dev) Cross-platform low-level I/O access
* cmake

Visual Studio users: it is recommended you build the ENet library yourself since
the .libs provided with the download are old and cause a SAFESEH (safe exception
handler) error when linking (tested in Visual Studio 2017). (TODO: build script?)

## Building
We use CMake as the cross-platform build system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mindwerks/XLEngine.git
cd XLEngine
mkdir build
cd build; 
cmake ..
make -j4
```

## Runtime Configuration
Game data paths and render settings are specified in XLEngine.conf. On non-
Windows systems, it will look for this in the XDG standard directory:
```
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/XLEngine/XLEngine.conf
```
or, if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset or empty:
```
$HOME/.config/XLEngine/XLEngine.conf
```

On all systems, it will then search for XLEngine.conf in the process's working
directory and use the settings there as overrides.

The available settings are:
```
[general]
width = # window/screen width, 320 minimum
height = # window/screen height, 200 minimum
fullscreen = # true or false
vsync = # true or false
emulate-low-res = # true to render at 320x200 and stretch to fit, or false
renderer = # opengl, soft32 (true-color software), soft8 (paletted software)

[DaggerXL]
data-path = # Full path to game data, e.g. C:\DAGGER\ARENA2

[DarkXL]
data-path = # ...

[BloodXL]
data-path = # ...

[OutlawsXL]
data-path = # ...
```

Currently the game must be run from where it can find the DarkXL/, DaggerXL/,
etc. directories, where the AngelScript (\*.as) and image (\*.png) files are for
the respective games, and the fonts/ directory with the necessary font files.
