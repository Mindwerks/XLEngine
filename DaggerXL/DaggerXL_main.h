// symbol defined on the command line. this symbol should not be defined on any project
// that uses this DLL. This way any other project whose source files include this file see 
// CPP_PLUGIN_API functions as being imported from a DLL, whereas this DLL sees symbols
// defined with this macro as being exported.
